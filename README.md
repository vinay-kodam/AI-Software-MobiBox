The MobiBox is a handheld that includes all sensors and intelligence needed to move/steer all kinds of vehicles (future vision). It can be plugged into an autonomous air taxi, a self-driving car, a city scooter, a bicycle or just carried around whenever you move. You thus have one smart, intelligence device and all the vehicles, scooters etc. are plain hardware pieces.
